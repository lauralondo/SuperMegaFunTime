2. Explore the different options in the menu, for example:
    - In 'Friends' send friend requests to other users and view your current friends
        - If you are already their friend you will not have the option to send another request
    - In 'You've Got Mail' accept friend requests and group invitations
        - Not an option if no friend requests or group invites
    - In 'My Group' send invitations to friends to join to your social group
        - You will not have this option if you are not part of a social group
        - You may only add people to a social group if you are a member of the group yourself
        - If you have already invited the friend to join you do not have the option to send
          another invitation
    - If you are not yet part of a group create one in 'Create A Group'
